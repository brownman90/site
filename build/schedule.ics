DESCRIPTION:While Ruby is object oriented and imperative\, it does have som
 e features that allow for functional programming. In this talk we’ll compar
 e Haskell\, a functional programming language\, with Ruby while exploring t
 hese common functional patterns: higher order functions\, lazy evaluation\,
  and memoization. Along the way we’ll explore how Ruby works internally\, f
 ind out whether it’s a true functional language\, and zoom in to take a clo
 se look at Ruby 2.0’s implementation of the new “Enumerator::Lazy” feature.

DESCRIPTION:Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the art and science of mak
 ing sense of user-generated data. It is a combination of state-of-the-art c
 omputer science techniques and linguistics. Being able to analyze plain tex
 t data allows us to gain a lot of insights. Popular NLP tasks are text summ
 arization\, keyword extraction or automatic extraction of the author's opin
 ion from a text. In the age of social media\, only NLP provides solutions t
 o analyze what users are really care about. Companies such as Google or Fac
 ebook invest millions in NLP solutions to harvest information from all the 
 data they have been gathering over the years. In this talk\, I will present
  you a real-world NLP problem. We will discuss this problem from both\, the
  linguistic and the computer science perspective. Throughout the talk\, we 
 will develop a processing pipeline to efficiently solve this problem in an 
 automated fashion. An NLP pipeline usually consists of multiple components\
 , each solving one aspect of the problem and presenting its own challenges.
  Among other things\, you will learn how to tackle the following essential 
 NLP problems using JRuby and OpenNLP.

DESCRIPTION:How often do you have to leave your comfort zone? How often doe
 s it happen that you need to change the fundamentals of your application? W
 ell… it has happened to my team recently. We had to abandon our way of thin
 king about Ruby on Rails applications. Single-threaded servers were not a c
 hoice anymore\, neither was JRuby nor Event Machine. And we had to handle u
 p to 200k requests per minute. This talk is a case study about how\, step b
 y step\, we got to multi threaded RoR application with MRI 1.9\, MySQL\, Da
 taMapper. I want to present how we came to the solution\, what did we have 
 to do to make our application thread safe\, how did we manage to use thread
 s in MRI and what we learned while working on the big feature\, that made u
 s change the fundamentals of our application. Although the application in t
 his case was built with Ruby on Rails\, the talk won't be specific to this 
 framework. I want to talk about threading and parallelism in Ruby and its o
 pen source libraries\, as well as the process of making deep changes in the
  application that handles pretty big traffic.

DESCRIPTION:Garbage collection is one of the pillars of Ruby's performance 
 story\, but getting into the inner workings of MRI's garbage collector is a
  bit hairy. If you want to explore the garbage collector then you're going 
 to have to get your hands deep into C code. We're going to take a walk thro
 ugh the C internals from Foo.new through garbage collection in Ruby's MRI. 
 We’ll examine the idioms and optimizations in the C source and leave you fe
 eling comfortable to explore the code yourself. At the end of the rb_newobj
 () rabbit hole is a whole world of garbage collection. Major changes have b
 een made in MRI's garbage collector from Ruby 1.8 through 2.0: changes inte
 nded to make Ruby more performant\, changes that can capitalize on MRI's ro
 ots in UNIX. From mark-and-sweep to copy-on-write and bitmap marking\, we'l
 l see what the future of Ruby performance might look like by peering throug
 h the window of the garbage collector.

DESCRIPTION:This talk is a tale about a time when Object-Oriented Programmi
 ng was about objects and messages\, not about classes and methods\, when it
  was about behavior\, not schemas. You will understand how OO was intended 
 to be used and what it means to say that OO is about messages. We'll talk a
 bout the past and then go back to the future to look at our Class-Oriented 
 Programming culture and how we can fix it by doing real OO in Ruby. By doin
 g that\, we'll start to understand why principles like SOLID and Demeter ar
 e here to help us stop losing time and money. This talk is about making you
  reevaluate the way you approach OO.

DESCRIPTION:You care about your code. You write nicely factored and clean c
 ode\, with nice and small methods that each do just what they are supposed 
 to do. Maybe you worry sometimes that these additional methods and small ob
 jects can be problematic? This talk hopefully makes you stop worrying about
  this. So with all this care that you do\, what can a Ruby implementation d
 o to make sure your code actually runs fast? In this talk I will discuss th
 e techniques used that allow your Ruby code to execute faster. How do we ma
 ke sure calling a method is cheap or even free? How can we let you mostly g
 et away with allocating a lot of objects? How do we make iterating with .ea
 ch as fast as a while loop? Different techniques will be discussed\, such a
 s inline caches\, just in time compilation\, method / block inlining and be
 tter garbage collection. As a Rubinius contributor I've worked on all these
  subjects so I know a few things about these topics\, but these will explai
 ned such that any Ruby developer can understand how these optimizations wor
 k. The quest for a faster Ruby is happening in a lot of places and you can 
 learn how this is done!

DESCRIPTION:Rails is a great framework for creating web apps... for awhile.
  What do you do when your codebase grows large? How do you handle large tea
 ms of developers? When performance becomes an issue\, how do you scale? Mos
 t importantly\, how do you write code which can easily be refactored later?
  This is a story of a real life project built from day 1 with all these que
 stions in mind. Learn about the problems we solved and lessons we learned: 
 how to partition your Rails app into distinct modular engines\, how to spee
 d up your test suite by only running code effected by your changes\, how to
  add a layer on top of ActiveRecord to enforce loose coupling\, and many ot
 her patterns that can be applied to your own Rails apps!

DESCRIPTION:All the cool cats are using Redis\, and with a reason: It's fas

  already and some common patterns when dealing with it.

DESCRIPTION:Great ideas start small\, hell\, just look at all the great ser
 vices we use today\, all of them small ideas which grew\, and grew\, and gr
 ew. Do you think they planned for this level of scale from the outset? God 
 no! And why would they? Planning too early can be the death of such a great
  idea! The mantra is simple\, start small\, growth will come naturally. Tha
 t might sound stupid\, but the idea is solid. As your product grows you wil
 l learn where the bottlenecks are\, where the pain points in code and proce
 ssing exist\, and what needs to scale and what needs to be thrown out the d
 oor. Travis CI was no different\, started as a simple Rails app\, it has no
 w grown into a platform built upon over 9 different apps\, using everything
  from Postgres\, Redis\, RabbitMQ\, Memcached\, S3\, BlueBox\, MRI\, JRuby\
 , Websockets\, and a huge array of services helping with email\, metrics\, 
 and alerts. We never designed or planned for this\, this came about from na
 tural growth\, and we have only just started. This talk is a story of archi
 tecture\, complexity\, and growth\, as well as a candid look on what we did
  wrong and could have done better. And most importantly\, this is a talk ab
 out how sometimes not building something is more important than building it
  in the first place.
